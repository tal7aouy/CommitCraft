## 1. Why Write Good Commit Messages?

- **Improves collaboration:** Helps team members understand the purpose and context of changes.  
- **Enhances code reviews:** Clear commit messages make it easier to review changes.  
- **Facilitates debugging:** Precise messages provide context for tracing issues.  
- **Supports project history:** Helps maintain a clear and meaningful Git log.

---

## 2. Anatomy of a Great Commit Message

### Structure:

1. **Subject line** (short, 50 characters or less):  
   - Summarize the change.  
   - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add," "Fix," "Refactor").  

2. **Body** (optional but recommended, 72 characters per line):  
   - Explain *why* the change was made.  
   - Highlight *what* changed.  
   - Discuss *how* the change was implemented.  

3. **Footer** (optional):  
   - Reference issues (e.g., "Closes #123").  
   - Mention breaking changes or other critical notes.  

---

## 3. Git Best Practices for Commit Messages

- Commit small, **atomic changes** for clarity.  
- Use **branch names** that reflect the purpose of the changes.  
- **Rebase** before merging to keep history clean.  
- Write commit messages that provide meaningful context, avoiding vague terms like "fix" or "update."  
- Avoid committing directly to the main branch.  

---

## 4. Commit Message Templates

### Standard Template:
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Example:
```
feat: Add user authentication module

Implement user login and registration functionality using OAuth.
Include unit tests for all authentication endpoints.

Closes #42
```

---

## 5. Using Emojis in Commit Messages

Emojis improve readability and convey intent quickly. Below is a suggested list:

- üí° `:bulb:` ‚Äì Idea or suggestion.  
- üîß `:wrench:` ‚Äì Fix or maintenance.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è `:gear:` ‚Äì Configuration changes.  
- ‚ú® `:sparkles:` ‚Äì New features.  
- üõ†Ô∏è `:hammer_and_wrench:` ‚Äì Refactoring.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `:warning:` ‚Äì Breaking changes.  
- üî® `:construction:` ‚Äì Work in progress (WIP).  
- üìà `:chart_with_upwards_trend:` ‚Äì Performance improvements.  

### Usage Example:
```
‚ú® feat: Add dark mode toggle

Implement a dark mode toggle button with local storage support.
```

Include common troubleshooting steps.
```

### Refactoring Code:
```
üõ†Ô∏è refactor: Simplify database query logic

## 7. Commit Message Conventions by Team Size

- **Small teams:** Focus on detailed descriptions, as fewer people share the context.  
- **Large teams:** Adhere strictly to templates and conventions to ensure clarity across diverse contributors.  

---

## 8. Automated Commit Validation

- **Leverage hooks:** Use Git hooks to enforce message style (e.g., via `commitlint`).  
- **Automate checks:** Integrate tools like Husky or Prettier to streamline workflows.  

---

## 9. Branch Naming Conventions

### Pattern
```
<type>/<ticket-number>-<short-description>
```

### Examples
- `feature/PROJ-123-user-authentication`  
- `bugfix/PROJ-456-fix-memory-leak`  
- `hotfix/PROJ-789-critical-security-patch`

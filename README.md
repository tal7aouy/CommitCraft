## 1. Why Write Good Commit Messages?

- **Improves collaboration:** Helps team members understand the purpose and context of changes.
- **Enhances code reviews:** Clear commit messages make it easier to review changes.
- **Facilitates debugging:** Precise messages provide context for tracing issues.
- **Supports project history:** Helps maintain a clear and meaningful Git log.

---

## 2. Anatomy of a Great Commit Message

### Structure:

1. **Subject line** (short, 50 characters or less):
    - Summarize the change.
    - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add," "Fix," "Refactor").

2. **Body** (optional but recommended, 72 characters per line):
    - Explain *why* the change was made.
    - Highlight *what* changed.
    - Discuss *how* the change was implemented.

3. **Footer** (optional):
    - Reference issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    - Mention breaking changes or other critical notes.

---

## 3. Git Best Practices for Commit Messages

- Commit small, **atomic changes** for clarity.
- Use **branch names** that reflect the purpose of the changes.
- **Rebase** before merging to keep history clean.
- Write commit messages that provide meaningful context, avoiding vague terms like "fix" or "update."
- Avoid committing directly to the main branch.

---

## 4. Commit Message Templates

### Standard Template:
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Example:
```
feat: Add user authentication module

Implement user login and registration functionality using OAuth.
Include unit tests for all authentication endpoints.

Closes #42
```

## 5. Using Emojis in Commit Messages

Emojis improve readability and convey intent quickly. Below is a suggested list:

- üí° `:bulb:` ‚Äì Idea or suggestion.
- üîß `:wrench:` ‚Äì Fix or maintenance.
- ‚öôÔ∏è `:gear:` ‚Äì Configuration changes.
- ‚ú® `:sparkles:` ‚Äì New features.
- üõ†Ô∏è `:hammer_and_wrench:` ‚Äì Refactoring.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `:warning:` ‚Äì Breaking changes.
- üî® `:construction:` ‚Äì Work in progress (WIP).
- üìà `:chart_with_upwards_trend:` ‚Äì Performance improvements.

### Usage Example:
```
‚ú® feat: Add dark mode toggle

Implement a dark mode toggle button with local storage support.
```
